You Will Be Found
Shannen Wu
Shannen is a junior studying computer science. She will be skating to You Will Be Found, a piece from one of her favorite musicals: Dear Evan Hansen. This piece is about being lifted up out of dark times by people around you, reminding you that you are not alone.

The Promise
Flora Su
Flora received her MEng in Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2018, and she has been figure skating for nearly 20 years now. An environmental engineer by day, figure skater at dawn, and artist by night, Flora doesn't get much sleep, but she is happy to be here tonight and would like to share that joy of skating with you all.
