Inspired by the film Weathering with You, the story of Grand Escape begins with a girl who has the special ability to bring happiness to those around her. At first, everyone is excited, but soon, excitement turns into expectations, and then into crippling dependence. What happens when a superpower proves to be both a blessing and a curse?

Andy Huang
Andy is an MIT alum who first started learning how to figure skate with the MIT figure skating club several years ago. He spends all of his mornings here at this rink and is so grateful to have discovered this club, and, for all of the people in it.

Ilani Axelrod-Freed, Phil Michael, Sue Lee
In their first individual program for the MIT Figure Skating Club show, Ilani Sai Axelrod-Freed -- with the help of club members Phil Machael and Sue Lee -- portrays the questionable joys of a first-time experience at a sleep over camp. Ilani is a junior at MIT majoring in course 18. They have never been to a sleepover camp. They spent their summers doing theater instead, so they hope their acting skills will be enough to convince you in this performance.


Juliana Drozd
Juliana is a senior and performing in her last MIT show as a student! She has been a member of the figure skating club for her entire time at MIT, serving as president for two years and as vice president until elections tomorrow. She's going to miss skating on MIT ice and being a part of this community when she graduates and moves away from Boston this spring.
